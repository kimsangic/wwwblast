wwwBLAST
===================
This standalone WWW BLAST server suite of programs was designed similar to the regular NCBI BLAST server and such command-line NCBI BLAST programs like "blastall", "blastpgp", "rpsblast" and "megablast". It incorporates most features, which exist in NCBI BLAST programs and should be relatively easy to use. This server does not support any request queuing and load balancing.

This project extends and customize wwwBLAST. Some of the changes are:
* Improved user interfaces.
* Scripts for upgrading the installed databases.
